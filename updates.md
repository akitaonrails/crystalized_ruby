* Makefile compiles on Ubuntu ([@akitaonrails](https://github.com/akitaonrails))
* String#blank? even faster now ([@kostya](https://github.com/kostya))
* Updated test inflector benchmarking
* Since this project has gotten a little bit of attention, I'll be adding some docs about contributing/developing/etc.

1. Inflectors are completely working
2. Regular expressions work, converting both directions (ruby -> crystal and vice versa)

#### 5/30 @ 182f5fb

This is now using an external shard for inflectors ([github/phoffer/inflector.cr](https://github.com/phoffer/inflector.cr)). It is not quite perfect but it's mostly working, please see that repo for more info.

* Set up benchmarking to compare the Ruby-ActiveSupport with the Crystal implementation. Results are very strong for Crystal.
* Realized I forgot to add a bunch of files to the repo. Those are all added and the instructions below should work now.

I've ported over all the relevant parts of ActiveSupport::Inflector. Basically everything except the two methods for constantizing and also the i18n stuff. To run:

```
cd active_support
crystal check_string.cr
crystal check_inflector.cr
make
ruby benchmark.rb
```

The only thing that's BROKEN is pluralize. It works except for words that are already plural, ending in 's', like "posts"/"words"

There's a benchmarking script for all this, and the results are pretty good. See `active_support/results.txt`
